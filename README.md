# vue-kendo
Kendo UI Core bindings for VueJS

This repository will be soon destroyed as this library will not use exclusively kendo UI, and may not use Kendo at all in the future.

The idea beneath it would be to have a set of normalized Vue components using interchangeable libraries, i.e. the component props would remain the same if we change library.

The new repository is called bbn-vue, it depends on the bbn library, working packages for NodeJS will release soon, check out @bbn on npmjs.
